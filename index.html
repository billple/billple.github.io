        <h2>Hi, there</h2>

              <p>
                I'm Bill, an aspiring web developer from New Jersey. I reside in Jersey City, born and raised.
                 I made my first site when I took a class in multimedia at New Jersey City University.
                 It's where I was first introduced to web development and continued to learn ever since.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Although I spent most of my years studying software engineering and learning complex algorithms, I became interested in web development.
                 Not until my junior year that I decided that this field was what I wanted to pursue.
                 I’ve worked hard to finally graduate within 3 years of only related CompSci courses.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 I have worked in IT for most of the years, but decided a career in software/web development was something I've enjoed and learned to be passionate for.
                  And so, I’ve embarked on a career in front-end web development. Everyday, I’m honing my skills, learning something new, and continuing to grow.
